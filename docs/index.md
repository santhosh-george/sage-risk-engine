## What is SaGe Risk Engine?

If you are a Medicare advantage plan you care about risk scores for your enrollees. Calculation of the HCC risk scores is what this engine can do. The SaGe Risk Engine calculates all the active risk model versions: V05, V21, V22, V24.  

### Where do I find information on the Risk Models?

Center for Medicare and Medicaid publishes the Risk adjustment models. These models are developed for the different Model Years. For more information refer to: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/Risk-Adjustors
