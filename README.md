The SaGe Risk Engine is a flexible data driven engine to calculate the risk adjustment factors (RAF) / risk scores based on CMS HCC (V22, V24, V21 (ESRD), V05 (RX)) models. The active models are included in the model and future models will be incorporated as CMS publishes the model software. The engine is developed for the Amazon Redshift platform. PostgreSQL and MySQL versions are also available. This codebase enables you to avoid SAS and calculate the risk score using the SaGe Risk Engine in the cloud (Redshift) or database on your local machine (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
