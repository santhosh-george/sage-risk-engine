The SaGe Risk Engine is a flexible data driven engine to calculate the risk adjustment factors (RAF / scores) based on CMS HCC, RX, and ESRD models. The active models are included in the model and future models will be incorporated as CMS publishes the model software. The engine is developed for the Amazon Redshift platform. PostgreSQL and MySQL versions are also available. Avoid SAS and calculate the score using the SaGe Risk Engine in the cloud (Redshift) or database on your local machine (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
